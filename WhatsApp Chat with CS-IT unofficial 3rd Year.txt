4) Central Education minister has stated the academic calendar will start most probably from October so no point of taking full fees 3 months before!

Don't join the group if you 
Have already paid the fees!

13/08/2020, 18:34 - +91 95252 91134: Dear Madam/Sir,

Please find attached herewith the branch/programm wise list of the students who have not yet registered in NAD yet apart from several notices and reminders. 

It is pertinent to mention here that students who are registering through Aadhar are being issued the NAD ID immediately; the students who are registering through Non-Adhar mode will be issued the same after verification from Patna and Mesra offices in due course, however they are being issued the Acknowledgement Number

As the NAD registration is mandatory for the ongoing semester registration process, all In-charges are requested to kindly inform the students of their respective branches to complete the process and send the NAD ID/Acknowledgement Number to kumarrajesh7000@gmail.com, latest by 14.08.2020 (Friday), as the same is required to be sent to Dean (A & AC) BIT Mesra so that the further process may be initiated.

For any further assistance students may contact on 9264450104.

This is submitted for your kind information and further needful action.

Please take it on utmost priority.

Thanking You,
With Regards,

Subject- Provide Offline Lectures
Sir, 
     May I have honour to say that our online classes has started for new Semester. I am not able to grasp things clearly in online classes. Many Students residing in remote areas can't even connect with ongoing classes. Even Faculty members too has to face internet issues and so the students. We already have very bad experience about online classes from previous Semester. 
Looking at the value of such huge amount that we paid, I request you to Provide us with Offline recorded lectures, So that everyone could avail the education in efficient way. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
Yours Sincerely,

05/12/2020, 16:32 - +91 87899 19448: We all students have been always supportive of our college administration in these unprecedented times but we feel our administration does not consider our welfare, it is the time we should help each other and focus on academics rather than taking the intimidating examinations.

Please consider these points.

1) Many students don't have laptops and many have left their laptops left at hostels. How are we supposed to buy laptops, give you fees for next sem, buy external cameras in such difficult financial times? there are students from J&K where they have 2G data available. Such camera angles are not possible. The field of view of a camera is limited.


2) The exams were not anticipated. The notice is *extremely short*. The syllabus is not complete and currently, teachers are rushing through. With 10 days left we have 15 quizzes left. The syllabus is being completed at 5:00 PM and the teachers are taking the quiz at 5:30. Teachers need more time to complete the syllabus.no time has been provided to study and prepare. We will not be able to perform well in exams.


3) There is no study material for us. Studying from ebooks and pdfs will take a lot of time and put a lot of stress on the eyes. Many of us don't have a laptop and/or external webcam. Procuring them at such short notice is impossible. Also, the lack of a stable internet connection makes it impossible to give the exam while uploading a steady video feed.

4)We are not able to conduct 25 mins module quiz how are we supposed to have a stable net connection for 2 hours 

5) These problems were informed to the authority before starting the semester, many students still reside in rural areas. Where the problem of the internet is still very much consistent.

Students have been lately feeling anxious due to sudden notices and announcements being made, causing severe mental stress, especially during these times.  We expect the administration to please take into account all the above points raised by the students and take a decision that is in the best interest for all of us.

06/12/2020, 13:33 - +91 6202 613 465: Yes. I have following issues:
1. Cutting short the duration of this semester which led to
    a.) Teachers covering the syllabus in a hurry. Finishing two weeks course in two days and then taking exams. 
   b.) Teachers mailing us the PDFs and then taking the quizzes and eventually endsem. Some are not even trying to cover. 
   c.) In some subjects, 4 internal quizzes are left. And two complete modules are left. How do you propose that gets covered in 4-6 lectures?

2. Preponing the exams that not even our teachers were sure were happening.

3. No preparation time for endsems although we used to get it in offline modes.

06/12/2020, 14:16 - Sunny Raj: Subject : Regarding End Semester Exam (On behalf of CSE/IT 3rd semester)

We all students have been always supportive of our college administration in these unprecedented times but we feel our administration does not consider our welfare, it is the time we should help each other and focus on academics rather than taking the intimidating examinations.

Please consider these points.

1) *Many students don't have laptops* and many have left their laptops left at hostels. How are we supposed to buy laptops, give you fees for next sem, buy external cameras in such difficult financial times? there are students from J&K where they have 2G data available. Such camera angles are not possible. *The field of view of a camera is limited.*


2) The exams were not anticipated. The notice is *extremely short*. The syllabus is not complete and currently, teachers are rushing through. With 10 days left we have 15 quizzes left. The syllabus is being completed at 5:00 PM and the teachers are taking the quiz at 5:30. Teachers need more time to complete the syllabus.no time has been provided to study and prepare. We will not be able to perform well in exams.


3) There is no study material for us. Studying from ebooks and pdfs will take a lot of time and put a lot of stress on the eyes. Many of us don't have a laptop and/or external webcam. Procuring them at such short notice is impossible. Also, the lack of a stable internet connection makes it impossible to give the exam while uploading a steady video feed.

4)We are not able to conduct 25 mins module quiz how are we supposed to have a stable net connection for 2 hours 

5) These problems were informed to the authority before starting the semester, many students still reside in rural areas. Where the problem of the internet is still very much consistent.

Students have been lately feeling anxious due to sudden notices and announcements being made, causing severe mental stress, especially during these times.  *We expect the administration to please take into account all the above points raised by the students and take a decision that is in the best interest for all of us.*

The pandemic is hopefully at it's end and we may end up in our hostels in the coming couple of months. 

In this  situation, how about a pump of motivation?
And who could be better than a fellow BITian?
A BITian who did great things during his time at the campus and even after that.

He was the first student from BIT to grab a foreign internship in his third year.

He managed to grab the second spot in India and his team was among the top 100 teams in the world in the prestigious "Microsoft Imagine Cup-2012"

While his PG from the University of Edinburgh he founded the Artificial Intelligence society "Edintelligence."

These are just some his achievements from a  very lengthy list.

So go register and get a chance to interact with him this sunday evening !

P.S. If you want to make a career in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning, this is your guy !!

Follow us @bitptechnical for further updates.

05/02/2021, 10:07 - +91 87892 39405: *Greetings from Team Nav Umeed🌈!!*

Internships are the bridge from higher education to the workplace.

_Higher degree college admissions like MBA colleges or foreign universities, Civil Services (UPSC) and even the corporate sector identifies a student’s volunteer commitment to a cause or an organization as one of the highly valued factor of a strong application._ It is because *working towards a cause, without a visible financial pay-out, indicates commitment and passion.* 🌼
Gaining work-experience in community service being a student can _*proudly embellish your resume.*_
Skills acquired in volunteer work – experience with the organization structure, time and people management, problem-solving, and most significantly, the expression of leadership qualities – are part of the wanted soft-skills in any employee. 

So, *Nav Umeed🌈 is providing an opportunity to students for community service in terms of a 30-days internship*. 
To know further details of the internship proposal or any enquiry contact : 
Ishita Singh - 6299446813

You step up a little and get so much back in return. And what’s better, you turn out to be an all-around nice person for having done so.

Saathi, to fir haath badhaaye?

Regards,
*Team Nav Umeed🌈*

07/04/2021, 15:57 - Xyz: Humari batch mate Swasti from CSE 2k17,  uske father ki recently sudden death hogayi hai. He was the only earning member of her family. Financial status is really not stable. Iss semester ki fees bhi nai gayi hai and that's why college is not allowing her to register. Total college fees is 1,20,000.

BIT Patna has asked to pay at least 50% of the total amount till this Friday. So we have decided to collect her fees among ourselves. 
This is her Gpay number. 
9631441201

Kindly donate in your capacity. Every donation counts. This is an earnest request 🙏🏻
We have only one day!!!!!!

Hello, I am Adel Aafaque Akhtar, a student of BIT Mesra, CSE 2k17 batch (roll number: BE/15005/17).

My mother Mrs. Rubina Akhtar has been hospitalized since 19th May, 2021, fighting covid and now post-covid complications. She is extremely oxygen dependent and is in a very critical stage, on a bi-vent currently. She is expected to stay in the hospital for 20-30 more days.

I have already lost my father, Late Mr. Aafaque Akhtar, to Covid complications on 18th May, 2021. With lakhs of hospital bills racking up and the primary breadwinner of the family no more, I request you all to kindly extend your support in these dire times.

09/07/2021, 11:40 - +91 93044 12390: Respected Vice Chancellor Sir,
This covid Pandemic has affected each one of us, socially, mentaly as well as financialy. In this Pandemic we are not using the resources of our college yet we are giving full fees.
I know institute have its own commitments, institute have to pay fees to its staff, professors and many more. But their is some resources which we are nit using yet we are paying for it.

1) We are not using the electricity of the institution. Neither in the college, nor in the hostel, but we are paying for it.
2) We are not using the high speed internet of the college, still we are paying for it.
3) We are not using the medical facilty provided by the college, still we are paying for it.
4) We are not using the transport service provided by the college, still we are paying for it.

Each family us facing some finacial issue, so I request you to reduce our fees by minimim 45,000 (45 K). 
Some have lost job and some have lost life, but I do believe that BIT will understand this and help its student.

08/02/2022, 00:41 - Shreya: Theory depends on hod

Internship hai, placement hai, hmlog ko padhna hai, prep krna hai
08/02/2022, 00:42 - Shreya: Notice me mentioned hai labs offline hi lena hai, but theory ka HOD pe depend kr rha
08/02/2022, 00:43 - Shreya: Toh hmlog HOD ke paas jaa rhe, convince krnge ki theory me online le lijiye aur thora relief dilwa dijiye bs iss sem ke liye
08/02/2022, 00:43 - Shreya: Kyu? 
Toh point by point mention kr denge
08/02/2022, 00:43 - Shreya: Ab rahi lab, toh even though wo likha hai offline, we will try to negotiate ki online le lijiye, kyuki hmlog ka online possible hai
08/02/2022, 00:44 - Shreya: Hmlog ko basically relief chahiye taaki aage ke bade chiz pe focus kr paaye thora
08/02/2022, 00:45 - Shreya: Ab badle me apko jo chahiye hmlog wo kr denge. Bs hmlog ko thora sa spare kr dijiye, iss semester tk bs
08/02/2022, 00:45 - Shreya: Ye bolna hai, ye discussion hai
08/02/2022, 00:45 - Shreya: Ab kisi ko dikkat hai iss baat se?
08/02/2022, 00:45 - +91 72090 61425: Nahi
08/02/2022, 00:45 - Shreya: Hm aise ek Gform bana denge, jisse votes count ho jayega
08/02/2022, 00:45 - Ansh Raj: Ye tb bolenge jab sir pehla baat maan jaye
08/02/2022, 00:46 - Rahul Singh Cse: Ha ye sahi hai
08/02/2022, 00:46 - Shreya: So that hmlog ek proper count ke sath jaaye ki x% ko online chahiye theory and y% online chahiye labs
08/02/2022, 00:47 - +91 87899 19448: Yeh point thoda stress karna , most likely innlog agree kar lenge
08/02/2022, 00:47 - Shreya: But iske pehle kisi ko bhi koi dikkat toh please yaha discuss kr lo, so that ek clear mind rahe hmlog ka bhi
08/02/2022, 00:47 - Shreya: Yes.
08/02/2022, 00:48 - +91 87892 39405: Agr yeah reason diya jayega toh hod kyu manenge ....hmlog se pehle v yeah sb hota tha na toh uss time toh full offline hoti thi na sb...toh abhi iss reason ko kyu consider karenge sir??
08/02/2022, 00:51 - Shreya: Ab dekho hm toh yaha speechless ho gaye, mtlb yaha tb baat kisliye kr rha sb
08/02/2022, 00:52 - Shreya: Tum hi batao kya reason denge HOD ko
08/02/2022, 00:52 - Shreya: Kya hai main reason
08/02/2022, 00:52 - +91 72090 61425: Hmlog last year ka example de skte h ki almost pura placement hua h to iss bar bhi try karege online me
08/02/2022, 00:52 - +91 87892 39405: Mesra mein ek mail gya tha sara hod ko
08/02/2022, 00:52 - +91 87892 39405: And incharge ko
08/02/2022, 00:53 - +91 87899 19448: Simply because 2 saal already online classes ho gaya. Most of the important topics in computer science already covered by 5th sem. Business communication aur constitution of India jaise subjects ke liye college aane se koi difference nahi hone wala. I think this is a valid point ?
08/02/2022, 00:54 - +91 87892 39405: Good Afternoon Sir/Mam,

This mail is regarding the notice that we received yesterday regarding the return of students to the institute. We would like to draw your attention to some of our concerns.

It will be very difficult to make arrangements on such short notice. Many students are finding it financially challenging to arrange for all their transportation and other necessities. There would be problems in arranging for tickets.
Many of us live in regions with a high number of active and daily new cases hence their families are scared as there are still 1.5 L daily cases in India. Many of us have lost our loved ones in covid and we are scared for our families in case covid cases rise and we have to return home. Our families are also concerned about the healthcare facilities available in Jharkhand like we have seen in the 2nd Wave.
	We will be residing in a hostel with shared washrooms and mess where it will be impossible to manage in case many students get infected. 
Moreover, so much chaos in such a crucial time will result in taking a toll on our placement preparation as we have to sit for placements in the next semester. Our college being a central level university hosts students from pan India and Most parents are hesitant to sign the undertaking form until the situation of the current state eases and other central universities start their full-fledged operations. Regional universities are opening but most central universities are still operating in online mode considering the safety of students.

Please give us time till mid-March at least so that we get time to prepare for our travel and make necessary arrangements for existing financial and family conditions.
08/02/2022, 00:54 - +91 87892 39405: This was mail jo gya tha mesra mein

08/02/2022, 14:52 - Tushar Raj: Good Afternoon Sir/Mam,

This mail is regarding the notice that we received yesterday regarding the return of students to the institute. We would like to draw your attention to some of our concerns.

It will be very difficult to make arrangements on such short notice. Many students are finding it financially challenging to arrange for all their transportation and other necessities. There would be problems in arranging for tickets.
Many of us live in regions with a high number of active and daily new cases hence their families are scared as there are still 1.5 L daily cases in India. Many of us have lost our loved ones in covid and we are scared for our families in case covid cases rise and we have to return home. Our families are also concerned about the healthcare facilities available in Jharkhand like we have seen in the 2nd Wave.
	We will be residing in a hostel with shared washrooms and mess where it will be impossible to manage in case many students get infected. 
Moreover, so much chaos in such a crucial time will result in taking a toll on our placement preparation as we have to sit for placements in the next semester. Our college being a central level university hosts students from pan India and Most parents are hesitant to sign the undertaking form until the situation of the current state eases and other central universities start their full-fledged operations. Regional universities are opening but most central universities are still operating in online mode considering the safety of students.

Please give us time till mid-March at least so that we get time to prepare for our travel and make necessary arrangements for existing financial and family conditions.

08/02/2022, 20:14 - Tushar Raj: Good Afternoon Sir,

This mail is regarding the notice that we received yesterday regarding the return of students to the institute. We would like to draw your attention to some of our concerns.

1. Many of our subjects are going to be conducted online regardless of, whether we choose to come to the college campus or not, therefore there is no point of discussion in coming to the college campus for attending a fewer classes in the offline format. We students don't just have to attend the classes but to stay, share the same washrooms and live in an unhygienic environment which the college faculty and the members aren't exposed to.

2. Most of these classes are non-Computer Science subjects which doesn't require us to be physically present in the classes. Moreover, we have a strength of around 90 students who can't attend the classes together and follow social distancing norms.

3. Our labs are conducted in a much better and orderly fashion in the online mode, since we share screens, programs virtually. We all get an enhanced learning experience that was otherwise not possible in physical labs.

4. We students of the CSE and IT branch are ready to appear for the offline End-semester exams which will be conducted at its designated date and time as per schedule. We just want our online classes to continue for this semester because it provides us to be efficient in our learning process.

5. The college wants us to sign the undertaking which states.; "I want to come to campus to attend offline classes." which we all don't . Signing this document and taking responsibility for our safety whilst being forced to come to campus, can't go hand in hand.
 Moreover, our parents and guardians aren't willing to sign the undertaking either.

6. Restating point 1, many of us students live in far-off states like Gujarat and Mumbai where the daily cases are crossing 3 lakhs per day. Expecting us to come together and stay in the hostel premises whilst sharing the same mess, same washrooms, etc for the sake of attending a few offline classes which can be conducted in a much better and efficient manner in the online mode doesn't make any sense to us.

7. Continuing the classes in the online mode allows us to stay in a healthy and hygienic environment whilst staying healthy we can invest our time in studies and preparations for our placements. As this is a crucial time of our career, we can't take any risks that might compromise our health and affect our academic performance. 
This will ensure that we are in a condition to perform academically well which will lead to getting us better placement prospects and bring valour to our college's reputation just like it happened last year with our seniors.

8. It's us, students who have to attend the classes, it's we who have to stay in the hostels, share washrooms and dining space. It's us who have to study for exams and also prepare for upcoming placements. Therefore it would be highly unfair for the college to put down our demands and grievances.

Keeping these points in mind we the students of CSE and IT of the 6th semester are unwilling to come to the college campus till the beginning of the end semester exams and want a fair and wise judgment on the college's part.
08/02/2022, 20:15 - Tushar Raj: this is the final draft of the e-mail,
if there is any suggestion or thing to add. please write it down.
08/02/2022, 20:27 - Tushar Raj: 6. Restating point 1, many of us students live in far-off states like Gujarat and Mumbai where the daily cases are crossing newer heights per day. Expecting us to come together and stay in the hostel premises whilst sharing the same mess, same washrooms, etc for the sake of attending a few offline classes which can be conducted in a much better and efficient manner in the online mode doesn't make any sense to us.

08/02/2022, 20:55 - +91 87899 19448: and let me make this clear yarr. signing this undertaking is an insult to our intellect. Ek aise institution jisko hum pay karte hain so that they can function for us, if they can force us to sign a document against our will, then in the future how won't we be exploited by the companies which will pay us for our functioning?
08/02/2022, 20:56 - +91 87899 19448: Kal ko salary bhi nahi negotiate kar paoge.
